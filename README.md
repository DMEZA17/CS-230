•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted me to design a web-based game called DRAW IT or LOSE IT that supported multiple teams and players in real-time gameplay. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I think I did a good job in my Evaluation section of the documentation. I was able to provide great details in each section.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? The UML diagram was the most helpful thing when developing code as it allowed me to see each class, attribute, method and I could see how some of the classes inherit from each other. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would like to revise my recommendation section. I would improve it by adding more details and examples of why my recommendation should be used in the making of the application. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I was able to interpret the user’s needs into my software design by making sure that the gameplay is going to be smooth, engaging and error free. Also, real-time gameplay and responsive design across all deceives and platforms were also important to implement in the design because it will allow the users to have a better experience, which is why it is important to consider the user’s needs when making the software design. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I approached the design by clearly understanding the business and technical requirements that The Gaming Room was wanting. I knew I had to focus on key aspects such as real-time gameplay, scalability and cross platform support. I will continue to make sure that I understand my client’s requirements when I make designs in the future, but I will continue to consider the user experience.
